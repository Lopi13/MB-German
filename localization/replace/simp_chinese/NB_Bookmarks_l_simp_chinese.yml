 bm_867:0 "The Viking Age"
 bm_867_desc:1 "By the middle of the 9th century, the Norse raiders and adventurers known as the Vikings had already begun to set their indelible mark on the map of Europe, establishing realms in Russia and the British Isles and travelling and raiding as far as the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Karling rulers, descendants of Charlemagne, ruled mighty realms in France, Germany and Italy, while the Muslim religion was now firmly established in Spain under the Umayyads. The Byzantine emperor held on, though suffering under increasing pressure from the Caliphate and the Bulgarians. West of the fractured Steppes, The Magyars were poised to make their claim on the Carpathian basin. Islam was spreading rapidly in Persia under rulers such as the Saffarids, and had penetrated into the Indus valley. Further East, the Hindu Pratihara dynasty was expanding."

His later accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of England and Denmark together. Cnut sought to keep this power-base by uniting Danes and English under cultural bonds of wealth and custom, as well as through sheer brutality. After a decade of conflict with opponents in Scandinavia, Cnut claimed the crown of Norway in Trondheim in 1028.

Despite near-constant warfare, Basil distinguished himself as an administrator, reducing the power of the great land-owning families who dominated the Empire's administration and military, filling its treasury, and leaving it with its greatest expanse in four centuries. Although his successors were largely incapable rulers, the Empire flourished for decades after Basil's death.

The marchlands of the region, which had long resisted Buyid authority, were finally subjugated. The Turkish mercenaries, however, became discontented over the presence Sultan al-Dawla's Daylamite troops. They therefore raised a brother of the amir, Musharrif al-Dawla, as their ruler in 1021.

On the other hand, Hakim's Syrian policy was successful as he managed to extend Fatimid hegemony to the emirate of Aleppo. Above all, the persistent rivalries between the various factions of the Fatimid armies, especially the Berbers and the Turks, overshadowed the other problems of Hakim's caliphate. Al-Ḥākim upheld diplomatic relations between the Fatimid Empire and many different countries. Skillful diplomacy was needed in establishing a friendly if not neutral basis of relations with the Byzantine Empire, which had expansionary goals in the early 11th century. Perhaps the farthest reaching diplomatic mission of his was to the Song Dynasty."

He initiated his arduous campaign to crush his rivals and reconquer the lost territory in Italy to reform the Holy Roman Empire. The Magyars settled down in the Carpathian Basin and began to make their mark on the world as they conquered and pillaged their neighbors, becoming feared across Europe. In the north the Christians were trying to push into the Scandinavian Peninsula to start converting the pagan kings, but the Germanic faith still stood strong among the vikings. In Baghdad far to the south-east, the ancient Abbasid Caliphate that once ruled an empire stretching from Persia to Hispania finally fell to infighting, left only with the heartland of their former empire. And on the shores of Africa a new rival rose up in the form of the Fatimid Caliphate, ready to fill the vacant regions left behind by their adversary. \n\n#bold Who will stand victorious after this tumultuous time in history?#!"

In his later years, after his coronation as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, he had to continue his struggles in Italy to keep his newfound empire under control.

Modern historians regard him as the first King of England and one of the greatest Anglo-Saxon kings. Æthelstan centralised government; he increased control over the production of charters and summoned leading figures from distant areas to his councils. These meetings were also attended by rulers from outside his territory, especially Welsh kings, who thus acknowledged his overlordship. More legal texts survive from his reign than from any other 10th-century English king. They show his concern about widespread robberies, and the threat they posed to social order. His legal reforms built on those of his grandfather, Alfred the Great. Æthelstan was one of the most pious West Saxon kings, and was known for collecting relics and founding churches. His household was the centre of English learning during his reign, and it laid the foundation for the Benedictine monastic reform later in the century."

Manuel had as-of-yet been without legitimate male issue, and intended Belá to be married to his daughter Maria, to eventually rule alongside her as Emperor. Sensing opportunity, however, Manuel decided to move against István and press his son-in-law’s claims on the duchies of Dalmatia and Croatia. With those titles secured, Belá is now a landed vassal of Manuel, and the heir to the Kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary.

When Henry became King of England in 1154, as Henry II, he ruled as king, duke or count over a large empire of kingdoms, duchies and counties that spanned from Scotland to the Pyrenees.

Under Saladin's command, the Ayyubid army defeated the Crusaders at the decisive Battle of Hattin in 1187, and thereafter wrested control of Palestine—including the city of Jerusalem—from the Crusaders, who had conquered the area 88 years earlier.

 bm_prelude_desc:1 "The Komnenoi have fallen from the imperial throne, and Byzantium is falling with them. The newly-formed Kingdoms of Serbia and Bulgaria have declared their independence from the Byzantine crown, the Seljuk Sultans of Rum press against the Empire’s restored borders in Anatolia, and an independent Béla III rules in Hungary and Croatia. All of Manuel Komnenos’s dreams have come to naught, but this is a time of opportunity, for those wise enough to see it. Alexios Komnenos, an infant member of the royal Komnenos dynasty, rules in Trebizond. If he can gather support enough to press his claim on Byzantium, the young Komnenos can work to restore the golden age his family’s untimely fall from grace brought to a close. Meanwhile Jerusalem stands poised to fall to Saladin while King Henry II of England, King Philip II of France, and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick 'Barbarossa' continue to fight amongst themselves."

Andronikos Doukas Angelos was the son of Constantine Angelos and Theodora Komnene, the youngest daughter of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and Irene Doukaina. Thus Isaac was a member of the extended imperial clan of the Komnenoi. On 11 September 1185, while Andronikos was absent from the capital, his lieutenant Stephen Hagiochristophorites moved to arrest Isaac. Isaac killed Hagiochristophorites and took refuge in the church of Hagia Sophia. Andronikos was a capable ruler in some ways but was hated for his cruelty and his efforts to keep the aristocracy obedient. Isaac appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose that spread rapidly over the whole city. When Andronikos returned he found that he had lost popular support, and that Isaac had been proclaimed emperor."

Then in 1182, he succeeded in capturing the city of Cotyaeum from the Byzantines. In 1185, he made peace with Emperor Isaac II Angelus, but the next year he transferred power to his eleven sons, who immediately fought each other for control.

Having arrived in the Holy Land (where his brother Aimery of Lusignan was already prominent) at an unknown date, Guy was hastily married to Sibylla in 1180 to prevent a political incident within the kingdom. As the health of his brother-in-law, Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, deteriorated, Guy was appointed by Sibylla as regent for his stepson, Baldwin V of Jerusalem. Baldwin IV died in 1185, followed shortly by Baldwin V in 1186, leading to the succession of Sibylla and Guy to the throne.

The prevalence of the Italian nickname, even in later German usage, reflects the centrality of the Italian campaigns to his career.  Historians consider him among the Holy Roman Empire's greatest medieval emperors. He combined qualities that made him appear almost superhuman to his contemporaries: his longevity, his ambition, his extraordinary skills at organization, his battlefield acumen and his political perspicacity.

He was, nevertheless, insecure and won the disapproval of his subjects by executing several high-ranking officials of the previous regime for treason. Under his rule, the Uyghur officials increased their dominance, sidelining the North Chinese and the Muslims.

Although Vaisvilkas’s realm is still relatively small, his pious Christianity buys him time and potential support from other Christian rulers. If he can gain that support and use it to hold off the Mongol horde, the ambitious young King of Lithuania might well be able to recover some of his ancestral lands lost to the Teuton knights… \n\n Meanwhile in Europe the House of Hohenstaufen is no more with the death of Manfred with Charles I of Anjou now ruling Sicily."

As an adult, Louis IX faced recurring conflicts with some of his realm's most powerful nobles, such as Hugh X of Lusignan and Peter of Dreux. Simultaneously, Henry III of England attempted to restore the Angevin continental possessions, but was promptly routed at the Battle of Taillebourg.

At the time of Abu Yahya's death in July, 1258, the Marinids were installed in Fez and controlled eastern and northern Morocco, the Almohads reduced to the southerly districts around their capital, Marrakech. Although Abu Yahya had designated his son as successor in Fez, Abu Yusuf Yaqub, then a governor in Taza, managed, with only a little difficulty, to displace his nephew and get himself acknowledged as emir of the Marinids. Abu Yusuf Yaqub's reign would see 4 military expeditions into Spain. While it is common to designate Abd al-Haqq or Abu Yahya as the founders of the Marinid dynasty, there is little doubt that Abu Yusuf Yaqub ought to be rightly regarded as the founder of the Marinid state. He put a final end to the Almohads, unified Morocco, established their new grandiose capital at Fez el-Jedid and gave the Marinids their foothold in Spain"

Ladislaus promised that he would force them to adopt a Christian lifestyle, but they refused to obey the legate's demands. Ladislaus decided to support the Cumans, for which Philip of Fermo excommunicated him. The Cumans imprisoned the legate, and the legate's partisans captured Ladislaus. In early 1280, Ladislaus agreed to persuade the Cumans to submit to the legate, but many Cumans preferred to leave Hungary. Ladislaus vanquished a Cuman army that invaded Hungary in 1282. Hungary also survived a Mongol invasion in 1285. Ladislaus had, by that time, become so unpopular that many of his subjects accused him of inciting the Mongols to invade Hungary."

Foremost among them is Osman, a pious and brave man. According to a dream he had many, many years ago, great things are in store for Osman and his dynasty. They might even conquer great Constantinople one day. But the journey to Constantinople won’t be easy, and the Byzantine Empire, which has resisted attack after attack for almost a thousand years, will not go down without a fight. \n\n Over in Europe due to the untimely death of the Polish monarch without a favorable heir, Vaclav II Premyslid of Bohemia has been crowned king in place of another Piast. This gives Vaclav—heir to Ottokar, and all the desire for revenge against the Hohenstaufens that comes with being his son—a great deal of power in Europe. If Vaclav is given time to consolidate and expand it is unlikely the Holy Roman Empire will ever be able to reassert its authority over Bohemia, with its control of the Italian peninsula already crumbling. The time to move is now!"

At first, many Mongol nobles were against him and organized a plot to kill the new khan. Öz Beg discovered the plot and crushed the rebels. His adoption of Islam as a state religion led to a conspiracy of Shamanist and Buddhist princes, whom he subdued severely. Khan Öz Beg urged the Mongol elite to convert to Islam, but at the same time, he preserved the lives of Christians and pagans such as Russians, Circassians, Alans, Finno-Ugric people, and Crimean Greeks as long as they continued to pay the jizyah in subjection to Islamic rule.

However, as squabbling warlords and belligerent nomads begin to carve out kingdoms and principalities, even fragile and destructive human ambition can offer hope. Great men rise to power, wielding authority divinely granted and by their swords and scepters in the name of peace, order, and stability. But even as an age of darkness seems to pass, there are still many whose plots and machinations can bring even kings to heel..."

Through inheritance, bribery, betrayal, and timely conquest the kings of England have been able to occupy well over half of the lands claimed by the French kings, and stand dangerously close to claiming the French crown. Philippe II, known to history as Auguste (Augustus or ‘the August’), the monarch that reversed the English conquests and restored French unity and prestige, seems to be in an impossible position—can you replicate his incredible feats? Elsewhere in the world, the Holy Roman Emperor has claimed the Kingdom of Sicily as his dynastic birthright."

 bm_1144_desc:1 "The Anarchy was a period of early English history in which the dynasty of the Norman conqueror William broke down and was replaced by the cadet house of Plantagenet. It began when the second Norman King of England, Henry I, died without legitimate issue. Although Henry attempted to place his daughter Matilda on the throne, the lords of England would not have it. In his daughter's place, a male descendant of William through the female line, Stephen de Blois, was declared king. Support for Stephen was not absolute, however, and there were many loyalists who sided with Matilda in the succession. Matilda herself was married to the first son of King Foulque of Jerusalem, Geoffrey of Anjou, later to be known as Geoffrey Plantagenet. Geoffrey has managed to conquer Normandy in her name, and the succession crisis between the powerful vassal and the weak King Stephen of England appears to be inevitable."

His reign was marked by the Anarchy, a civil war with his cousin and rival, the Empress Matilda, whose son, Henry II, succeeded Stephen as the first of the Angevin kings of England after the signing of the Treaty of Winchester, in which Stephen recognised Henry as his heir in exchange for peace, passing over William, Stephen's second son.

Rumors carried across the Silk Road and the Indian Ocean have told of how Genghis Khan and his invincible Mongol hordes shattered the greatest empires of the known world, from Cathay to Persia. Though Genghis Khan is now dead, the sons and grandsons of Genghis intend to continue his conquests. They have their eyes upon Europe and the rest of the Middle East, and the entire world may be united under the banner of Genghis… if his descendants do not end up fighting among themselves, that is. Perhaps the end of days has finally come at last, a punishment for the sins of the wicked… or perhaps this is God’s greatest test yet for the faithful.\n\nThe Fourth Crusade has left Byzantium crippled, and its prior vassal states do not fare much better. Three powerful Dukes vie for control of Greece proper, and only one of them is Greek.

Archaeological evidence reveals that Chernihiv towns enjoyed an unprecedented degree of prosperity during his period which suggests that promoting trade was a priority for him. Commercial interests, in part, also motivated him to seize control of Halych and Kiev because they were channels through which goods from the Rhine valley and Hungary passed to Chernihiv. He also negotiated commercial treaties and political alliances with the Poles and the Hungarians and alleviated the tax burden of the Novgorodians and granted their boyars greater political freedom from the prince. He was the last autonomous senior prince of Kiev, where he was deposed not by a more powerful prince but by the invincible Mongols. On the eve of Mongol invasion, he was one of the most powerful princes in Rus'.

Under Haakon's rule, medieval Norway is considered to have reached its zenith or golden age. His reputation and formidable naval fleet allowed him to maintain friendships with both the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor, despite their conflict. He was at different points offered the imperial crown by the pope, the Irish high kingship by a delegation of Irish kings, and the command of the French crusader fleet by the French king. He amplified the influence of European culture in Norway by importing and translating contemporary European literature into Old Norse, and by constructing monumental European-style stone buildings. In conjunction with this he employed an active and aggressive foreign policy, and at the end of his rule added Iceland and the Norse Greenland community to his kingdom, leaving Norway at its territorial height.

Count Henry demanded that Denmark surrender the land conquered in Holstein 20 years ago and become a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor. Danish envoys refused these terms and Denmark declared war. While Valdemar sat in prison, most of the German territories tore themselves away from Denmark and the war ended with Danish defeat. To secure his release Valdemar had to acknowledge the break away territories in Germany, pay 44,000 silver marks, and sign a promise not to seek revenge on Count Henry. Valdemar immediately appealed to Pope Honorius III to have his oath declared void. Honorius III excused Valdemar from his forced oath, and he immediately set about trying to restore the German territories. A series of Danish defeats cemented the loss of Denmark's north German territories. From that time on, King Valdemar II focused his efforts on domestic affairs. One of the changes he instituted was the feudal system. This increased the power of the noble families and gave rise to the lesser nobles, who controlled most of Denmark.

In 1210, relations deteriorated, and John invaded Gwynedd in 1211. Llywelyn was forced to seek terms and to give up all lands east of the River Conwy, but was able to recover them the following year in alliance with the other Welsh princes. He allied himself with the barons who forced John to sign Magna Carta in 1215. By 1216, he was the dominant power in Wales, holding a council at Aberdyfi that year to apportion lands to the other princes. Following King John's death, Llywelyn concluded the Treaty of Worcester with his successor, Henry III, in 1218. During the next fifteen years, Llywelyn was frequently involved in fights with Marcher lords and sometimes with the king, but also made alliances with several major powers in the Marches.

It was from Scone, a site held sacred by the Scots, that Ormesby had been dispensing English justice. Ormesby was forewarned of Wallace's imminent assault and hastily fled. On hearing about the start of an aristocratic uprising, Edward I, although engaged in events in France, sent a force of foot soldiers and horsemen under Sir Henry Percy and Sir Robert Clifford to resolve the "Scottish problem".

 bookmark_england1297_desc:1 "Edward I, also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots, was King of England from 1272 to 1307. Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. Edward responded to a second Welsh rebellion in 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards the Kingdom of Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over Scotland. The war that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points."

 bookmark_bohemia1297_desc:1 "Wenceslaus II Přemyslid was King of Bohemia (1278–1305), Duke of Cracow (1291–1305), and King of Poland (1300–1305). He was the only son of King Ottokar II of Bohemia and Ottokar's second wife Kunigunda. In 1291, Przemysł II, High Duke of Poland, ceded the sovereign Duchy of Kraków to Wenceslaus. Kraków was associated with the overlordship of Poland, but Przemysł held the other duchies and in 1295 was crowned King of Poland. After Przemysł's death in 1296, Wenceslaus became overlord of Poland and in 1300, and had himself crowned King of Poland. In 1301, Wenceslaus' kinsman Andrew III of Hungary died and the Árpád dynasty became extinct in the male line. Wenceslaus was one of the relatives who claimed the throne, and he accepted it from a party of Hungarians on behalf of his young son, betrothed to Andrew's only child, Elizabeth. On 27 August 1301, his son was crowned in Székesfehérvár as king of Hungary. At that time the Kingdom of Hungary was split into several de facto principalities, and young Wenceslaus was only accepted as the King of Hungary by the rulers in Upper Hungary, in modern day Burgenland and on territory around the capital, Buda. But the Abas and Matthew Csák switched sides in 1303 and started to support Wenceslaus' rival Charles Robert of Anjou. Consequently, the young Wenceslaus, in Ofen (Buda), became afraid and wrote to his father in Prague for help. His father took a large army and invaded Buda, but having considered the situation, he took his son and the Hungarian crown and returned to Bohemia (1304)."

 bookmark_hre1297_desc:1 "Adolf was the count of Nassau from about 1276 and the elected king of Germany from 1292 until his deposition by the prince-electors in 1298. He was never crowned by the pope, which would have secured him the imperial title. He was the first physically and mentally healthy ruler of the Holy Roman Empire ever to be deposed without a papal excommunication. Adolf died shortly afterwards in the Battle of Göllheim fighting against his successor Albert of Habsburg. He was the second in the succession of so-called count-kings of several rivalling comital houses striving after the Roman-German royal dignity. On Pentecost 1297 the Elector of Brandenburg, Duke of Saxony, and King of Bohemia joined together to enforce their interests. The Elector of Mainz, Gerhard II, was associated with this group."

 bm_769:0 "Early Middle Ages"
 bm_769_desc:1 "The Early Middle Ages started with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the early 5th century. The earlier part of this era saw the great Germanic and Slavic migrations across Europe, with peoples such as the Goths and Lombards settling in Southern Europe, the Franks settling in Gaul and Saxons crossing the sea and settling in Britain. The Eastern Roman Empire was violently shaken by the pressure from the Goths and Avars, and fought bitterly with the ancient Persian enemy. The rise of Islam saw the Arabs conquering immense amounts of territory in the Middle East and North Africa and the fall of the Persian Empire, and in India several great dynasties vied for dominance, with the Rashtrakutas rising towards the end of the 8th century. In the steppes, the Khazars grew in power, and in Scandinavia things were about to change in a way that was to affect the entire continent..."

 bookmark_saxony769_desc:1 "Widukind, also known as Wittekind, was a leader of the Saxons and the chief opponent of the Frankish king Charlemagne during the Saxon Wars from 777 to 785. Charlemagne ultimately prevailed, organized Saxony as a Frankish province, massacred thousands of Saxon nobles, and ordered conversions of the pagan Saxons to Christianity. In later times, Widukind became a symbol of Saxon independence and a figure of legend."

He fought wars against the Chalukyas and Pratiharas and conquered Karnataka, making his dynasty more powerful than ever before. He was also a great patron to builders and commissioned many new temples and monuments."

 bookmark_abassid769_desc:1 "Al-Mansur became sole ruler of the Caliphate after the death of his brother. After defeating several potential challengers to his rule, he led a long and relatively stable reign over his huge empire. His time in power saw the rise of new Islamic literature and scholarship, thanks to cultural tolerance, conversion of new peoples and groups to Islam and a further inclusion of the Persian world into the Caliphate. His reign also saw tentative diplomatic contacts with realms as far away as China."

 bookmark_andalusia769_desc:1 "Abd-al-Rahman I was born near Damascus in Syria, but had to flee his homeland when the Abbasids took power. He spent several years in exile before arriving in Spain, where he managed to seize power and declare himself ruler of Al-Andalus. He wanted to return east and avenge himself on the Abbasids, but the need to deal with issues closer to home kept preventing him from doing so. He instead set his mark on the history of Spain, establishing the rule of his dynasty there for centuries to come."
 
 bookmark_ere769:0 "Constantine V"
 bookmark_ere769_desc:1 "Constantine V was Byzantine emperor from 741 to 775. His reign saw a consolidation of Byzantine security from external threats. As an able military leader, Constantine took advantage of civil war in the Muslim world to make limited offensives on the Arab frontier. With this eastern frontier secure, he undertook repeated campaigns against the Bulgars in the Balkans. His military activity, and policy of settling Christian populations from the Arab frontier in Thrace, made Byzantium's hold on its Balkan territories more secure. Religious strife and controversy was a prominent feature of his reign. His fervent support of Iconoclasm and opposition to monasticism led to his vilification by later Byzantine historians and writers, who denigrated him as Kopronymos or Copronymus, meaning the dung-named."

 bookmark_italy769_desc:1 "Desiderius became King of the Lombards in 756 after putting down the revolt of his rival Ratchis. Throughout his reign, he was constantly in competition with the popes and the southern dukes for domination of Italy. He sought an alliance with Charlemagne but when the latter divorced his daughter relations were soured. Eventually the kingdom was invaded and conquered by the Franks, making Desiderius the last Lombard king."
 
 bookmark_francia769:0 "Charlemagne"
 bookmark_francia769_desc:1 "Son of Pepin the Short and a descendant of Charles Martel, Charlemagne (or Karl, as his contemporaries called him) became joint king of the Franks with his brother Karloman in 769. After a two-year power struggle, Karloman suddenly and conveniently fell ill and died, leaving Karl as sole ruler of the Franks.  He then proceeded to make the kingdom greater than ever before, conquering Saxony, Lombardy and other lands with equal measures of good strategic planning and ruthlessness. He was eventually crowned Holy Roman Emperor by pope Leo III, and his descendants were to rule large parts of Europe for a long time to come."

 bookmark_middlefrancia769_desc:1 "Karloman became joint king of the Franks together with his brother Karl in 768. The two brothers were not friends, rather a rivalry ensued. Karloman was outmaneuvered by his brother's alliance with the Lombards, and sought the support of the Pope in order to counter this, but did ultimately not succeed. He died unexpectedly in 771, just as war for the Frankish crown seemed inevitable. It has been claimed that he was poisoned, but this was never proven..."
 
 bookmark_asturias769:0 "Aurelius"
 bookmark_asturias769_desc:1 "Aurelius was the King of Asturias from 768 to his death. His seems to have been a relatively quiet and peaceful reign, attested by the near-absence of mention of his reign in the medieval chronicles. The only event of his reign narrated in the chronicles was a rebellion of serfs, which Aurelius put down. The location of the uprising is unknown, but it is the first recorded instance of anti-seignorial revolt in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. It is believed that, according to the custom of the times, he negotiated peace with the Muslims who dominated the lands to his south by an exchange of brides."
